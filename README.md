## Introduction
Attempt to create a python script that monitors a telegram bot URL and replies to commands for logging data related to Bristol 'poop' measures.

Check more information about [Telegram Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots/).

## Important
- The bot will only allow direct interactions, not being added to groups for increased privacy

## Notes
- On first execution it will create database and start filling values

## Test
- I've a copy running with the name `@cagolin_bot`.  Give it a try or click  <https://telegram.me/cagolin_bot>.

## Usage
- The bot should give you requests with custom keyboards for each data it requires and operations like filling new values, consulting historical data, etc.
